# ðŸŽ² Law of Large Numbers: Dice Rolling Simulation

## Description

The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental theorem in probability theory stating that as a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population. In this case, we observe how random fluctuations in dice rolls smooth out over time, approaching the expected probability.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time animated plotting using matplotlib
- Seaborn dark grid styling for visual appeal
- Gold line showing actual relative frequency
- Crimson dashed line indicating theoretical probability (1/6)
- Optimized animation with blitting for smooth performance
- Demonstrates statistical convergence in an intuitive way

**Educational Value:**
Perfect for statistics students, educators, or anyone wanting to visualize how probability theory works in practice. Shows the difference between short-term randomness and long-term predictability.
